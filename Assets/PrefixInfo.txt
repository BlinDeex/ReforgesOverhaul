Challenger > Holding weapon in hand enables very hard minigame:
Orbs start appearing around you with short lifetime with these colors:
Green orb - increases total damage and defense by 2%
Blue orb - increases total projectile velocity by 5% and critical chance by 10%
Yellow orb - shooting it gives you both green and blue orb effects and heals you for 10hp
Missing green blue or yellow orb reduces your score and increases when hit
Red orb - shooting it resets your score completely, you also take 25 damage, missing this orb does nothing
beneficial orbs have very short interval where they shine brighter than usual, hitting them during that time increases score even more,
orb hits add their stats to the current pool collected from all the previous orbs then gets multiplied by current score which then multiplies corresponding player stat ie:
4 green orb hits add 2% * 4 = 8% damage and defense increase to the pool, with score of 3 it becomes 24% and then both defense and damage gets multiplied by 1.24
